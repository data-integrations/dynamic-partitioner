CDAP Plugins for Sinks that allow you to specify a list of fields, and leverage the values as partitions in the dataset.

Build
-----
To build this plugin:

```
   mvn clean package
```    

The build will create a .jar and .json file under the ``target`` directory.
These files can be used to deploy your plugins.

Deployment
----------
You can deploy your plugins using the CDAP CLI:

    > load artifact <target/plugin.jar> config-file <target/plugin.json>

For example, if your artifact is named 'kudu-sink-1.0.0':

    > load artifact target/dynamic-partitioner-1.0.0.jar config-file target/dynamic-partitioner-1.0.0.json
